https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/

Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an
integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1
- y2)2).

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order
that it is in).


Example 1:

Input: points = {{1,3},{-2,2}}, k = 1
Output: {{-2,2}}
Explanation:
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just {{-2,2}}.

Example 2:

Input: points = {{3,3},{5,-1},{-2,4}}, k = 2
Output: {{3,3},{-2,4}}
Explanation: The answer {{-2,4},{3,3}} would also be accepted.


Constraints:

    1 <= k <= points.length <= 104
    -104 < xi, yi < 104
